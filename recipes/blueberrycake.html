        <h3>A nice tender blueberry cake — one of my mom's specialties from years ago. It is a great cake to take along to a picnic.</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/½ cups all-purpose flour</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
            <li>1/½ cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch pan.</li>
            <li>Beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until soft and fluffy; mix in vanilla and salt. Add egg yolks and beat until creamy.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and baking powder in a bowl; add alternately with milk to creamed mixture.</li>
            <li>Toss blueberries with 1 tablespoon flour in a small bowl. Add to the batter and fold in gently.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a separate bowl until soft peaks form. Add remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites into cake batter.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
