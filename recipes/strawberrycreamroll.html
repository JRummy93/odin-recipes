        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup hot water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup sifted all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>¼ cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream, chilled</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, for dusting (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a jelly roll pan. Line it with buttered foil or buttered parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs until thick and lemon colored. Gradually add 1 cup white sugar, beating constantly. Stir in water and vanilla extract. Fold in flour, baking powder, and salt. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake until cake is springy to the touch and beginning to shrink away from the sides of the pan, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lay out a tea towel, and sprinkle it with confectioners' sugar. Turn the cake out on the towel. Peel off the paper or foil. Cut away crusty edges with kitchen shears or a sharp paring knife. Roll the cake up in the towel, and leave it to cool.</li>
            <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and set aside. Wash and hull the strawberries; if they're large, you may halve or chop them. Melt gelatin in microwave, checking every 15 seconds. Pour gelatin and 1 tablespoon sugar over strawberries.</li>
            <li>Whip the cream to medium-stiff peaks. Fold in cooled strawberry mixture. Unroll the cake, spread with the strawberry cream, and roll up again. Chill cake for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Before serving, dust cake with confectioners' sugar or top with additional whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
